# xen-guest-agent

The `xen-guest-agent` repository will be the new upstream for the Xen agent running in Linux/BSDs (POSIX) VMs.

Goals are:
* providing a unified upstream source repo for distro maintainers
* writing it from scratch to make it simple as possible
* building it with an incremental approach (Linux support first)
* being community driven
* splitting clearly the agent from libs (xenstore-read/writeâ€¦)
* reducing the burden to package it for distro's
* being portable (Linux, BSD, eventually Windows and others)

## General design

### Features

The agent gathers some guest information, and writes them to xenstore
so tooling in dom0 can read it.  The default behavior is to be
compatible with the XAPI toolstack as currently used in XCP-ng and
Citrix Hypervisor / Xenserver, and thus roughly follow what
`xe-guest-utilities` is doing.

We want it to become more largely useful; for this the collection
scope and publication structure still need to stabilize, and proposals
are discussed in [a separate document](doc/structure.md).

Current features:

* Network metrics (vif ID, MAC, v4/v6 address)
* OS reporting
* Memory metrics (total, free)
* Support for squeezed ballooning controller on toolstack size

Some features to consider (from `xe-guest-utilities`):
* Disk metrics
* "PV drivers version"

## Rust prototype

### Runtime requirements

The agent will fail to start if it cannot write the collected info to
Xenstore, so will only run in a Xen guest.

When built without `-F static`, the agent depends on the availability
of `libxenstore3.so` or `libxenstore4.so` (probed and loaded at
runtime).  This library can be found in the `libxenstore3` or
`libxenstore4` package on Debian-based Linux distros, and in
`xen-tools` in FreeBSD ports.

When built with Netlink support on FreeBSD, the resulting binary will
only work when the `netlink` module is loaded (check with `kldstat`,
load with `kldload netlink`).

### Build requirements

You need a Rust 1.77 toolchain or later.

Since the Cargo tool cannot be told about non-Rust dependencies, you
have to install manually on your build machine:
- pkg-config (on FreeBSD, provided by `pkgconf`)
- packages needed to build a crate linking against a native lib
  (`llvm-dev` and `clang` on Debian-based Linux distros)
- building as a static binary requires development files for
  libxenstore (package `libxen-dev` on Debian-based Linux distros,
  `xen-tools` on FreeBSD)

### How to build

The base command is simply:

```
cargo build
```

Proper feature selection is made difficult by [cargo not yet allowing
to declare features as conflicting
alternatives](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2980), and its
inability to declare default features depending on the target OS or OS
version.

By default it will (attempt to) build a `netlink` network collector
(which is only known to work on Linux, and will work on FreeBSD 13.2
and later once dependencies get the necessqry support), and a
`xenstore` data publisher.  Today the alternatives to the
`net_netlink` network collector are a "no-op" one (not collecting
anything), and a `net_pnet` one (periodically scanning the guest
interfaces using the portable `pnet` crate).  Similarly the only
alternative to the `xenstore` data publisher is a "mostly-no-op" one
publishing to stdout.

Building with the `--no-default-features` flag with select those
"no-op" implementations instead.  Selecting only one "no-op"
implementation, or selecting an alternative feature like `net_pnet`
requires starting similarly with no feature, and adding those you want
with `-F`.

For example to test the xenstore publisher without network support,
you can use:

```
cargo build --no-default-features -F xenstore
```

and for a Unix-like guest OS without netlink support:

```
cargo build --no-default-features -F xenstore,net_pnet
```

### How to run

The behavior can be adjusted by a few command-line options and
environment variables.

#### Command-Line

* `-s`, `--stderr`: send logs to stderr instead of going to the system
  logger. Note that the only system logger currently available is
  `syslog`, used on Unix platforms.  On other platfoms already write
  to stderr so this option on those systems is a no-op.
* `-l <LOGLEVEL>`, `--loglevel=<LOGLEVEL>`: selects the highest level
  of details to print.  Only affects stderr logging, and affects all
  libraries used by this program, see `RUST_LOG` below for a better
  option.

#### Environment

* `RUST_LOG`: logging to `stderr` uses the `env_logger` crate, see
  [its documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/)
  for full details.  Example useful values:
  * `RUST_LOG=info,xen_guest_agent::publisher=trace`: log every change
    to data published to xenstore
  * `RUST_LOG=warn,netlink_proto::codecs=trace,xen_guest_agent=trace`:
    get insight into data read from Netlink and what we're doing with them
* `XENSTORE_SCHEMA`: select the schema to use for publishing of data in Xenstore.
  Possible values:
  * `std`: (default value) network info according to [the xenstore-path
    doc](https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/unstable/misc/xenstore-paths.html#domain-controlled-paths),
    the rest compatible with what XAPI currently expects
  * `rfc`: alternate layout as proposed in [a separate document](doc/structure.md)

### Current state, limitations

* we decided to play with Rust [for various
  reasons](https://xcp-ng.org/blog/2023/03/17/bringing-rust-to-the-xen-project/)
* the prototype was written with Rust async programming features, both
  because it is the natural way to use the netlink crates, and for
  experimentation purposes to get a grasp on Rust's take on the
  subject
* it is written around the idea of various information collectors
  (today: OS, kernel, network, memory) and publishers (today:
  XenStore, with compatibility for today's Xenserver tool or with an
  alternative "rfc" structure), with additional helpers
  (identification of whether a NIC is a VIF, with a rough /sys-based
  implementation for Linux, and a rough implementation for FreeBSD
  based on interface name)
* memory collectors are implemented only for Linux and FreeBSD (the
  FreeBSD one could possibly be activated on other BSD variants)
* access to Xenstore is done using Mathieu Tarral's early-stage work
  on [Rust Xenstore bindings](https://lib.rs/crates/xenstore-rs).  An
  official Rust Xenstore API will be required at some point; another
  candidate would be Starlab's [pure-Rust libxenstore
  implementation](https://github.com/starlab-io/xenstore-rs), which is
  also in a prototype state
* the Xenstore publisher's "std" schema exposes only information
  currently identified as used by the XAPI/XenOrchestra stack (notably
  MAC addresses for VIFs are not exposed yet, even though they appear
  in [the xenstore-path
  doc](https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/unstable/misc/xenstore-paths.html#domain-controlled-paths))
* the Linux VIF-identification implementation is simplistic, skipped
  the SR-IOV case
* the fallback VIF-identification implementation (expectedly) causes
  no NIC to be reported at all
* the VIF-identification mechanism is currently disabled by editing
  the code (`ONLY_VIF` flag), and this interferes with the
  `XENSTORE_SCHEMA=rfc` mode, which would otherwise be able to publish
  information about non-VIF network interfaces
* for ease of experimentation, alternative implementations of
  collectors and publishers are selectable at compile-time, though a
  number of those choices will make sense as runtime options
* similarly, some behaviours are tunable by modifying flags in the code
* error handling is typical of a proto (but Rust will make fixing this
  unexpectedly easy, having forced the use of well-identified
  constructs like `.unwrap()` and `?` right from this early stage)
