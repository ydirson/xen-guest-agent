# xen-guest-agent

The `xen-guest-agent` repository will be the new upstream for the Xen agent running in Linux/BSDs (POSIX) VMs.

Goals are:
* providing a unified upstream source repo for distro maintainers
* writing it from scratch to make it simple as possible
* building it with an incremental approach (Linux support first)
* being community driven
* splitting clearly the agent from libs (xenstore-read/writeâ€¦)
* reducing the burden to package it for distro's

## General design

### Features

The agent gathers some guest information, and writes them to xenstore
so tooling in dom0 can read it.  The default behavior is to be
compatible with the XAPI toolstack as currently used in XCP-ng and
Citrix Hypervisor / Xenserver, and thus roughly follow what
`xe-guest-utilities` is doing.

We want it to become more largely useful; for this the collection
scope and publication structure still need to stabilize, and proposals
are discussed in [a separate document](doc/structure.md).

Current features:

* Network metrics (vif ID, MAC, v4/v6 address)
* OS reporting
* Memory metrics (total, free)

Some features to consider (from `xe-guest-utilities`):
* Disk metrics
* "PV drivers version"
* If ballooning is enabled

### Rust prototype

Current state, limitations:

* we decided to play with Rust [for various
  reasons](https://xcp-ng.org/blog/2023/03/17/bringing-rust-to-the-xen-project/)
* the prototype was written with Rust async programming features, both
  because it is the natural way to use the netlink crates, and for
  experimentation purposes to get a grasp on Rust's take on the
  subject
* it is written around the idea of various information collectors
  (today: OS, kernel, network, memory) and publishers (today: XenStore
  with compatibility for today's Xenserver tool aka "xenstore-std",
  XenStore with an alternative structure aka "xenstore-rfc"), with
  additional helpers (identification of whether a NIC is a VIF, with a
  rough /sys-based implementation for Linux, and a rough untested
  implementation for FreeBSD based on interface name)
* access to Xenstore is done using Mathieu Tarral's early-stage work
  on [Rust Xenstore bindings](https://lib.rs/crates/xenstore-rs),
  which we [enhanced with write
  access](https://github.com/Wenzel/xenstore/pull/10).  An official
  Rust Xenstore API will be required at some point; another candidate
  would be Starlab's [pure-Rust libxenstore
  implementation](https://github.com/starlab-io/xenstore-rs), which is
  also in a prototype state
* the "xenstore-std" publisher exposes only information currently
  identified as used by the XAPI/XenOrchestra stack (notably MAC
  addresses for VIFs are not exposed yet, even though they appear in
  [the xenstore-path
  doc](https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/unstable/misc/xenstore-paths.html#domain-controlled-paths))
* the Linux VIF-identification implementation is simplistic, skipped
  the SR-IOV case
* the fallback VIF-identification implementation (expectedly) causes
  no NIC to be reported at all
* the VIF-identification mechanism is currently disabled by editing
  the code (`ONLY_VIF` flag), and this interferes with the
  `XENSTORE_SCHEMA=rfc` mode, which would otherwise be able to publish
  information about non-VIF network interfaces
* for ease of experimentation, alternative implementations of
  collectors and publishers are selectable at compile-time, though a
  number of those choices will make sense as runtime options
* similarly, some behaviours are tunable by modifying flags in the code
* a single implementation for network-configuration info listening to
  netlink events is provided, with as alternative a no-op collector
  for un-/not-yet- supported OS
* error handling is typical of a proto (but Rust will make fixing this
  unexpectedly easy, having forced the use of well-identified
  constructs like `.unwrap()` and `?` right from this early stage)


## What's next?

0. Discuss with the community about the PoC before going further (design, review etc.)
1. Converge with an implementation in the main branch and start to advertise about it
